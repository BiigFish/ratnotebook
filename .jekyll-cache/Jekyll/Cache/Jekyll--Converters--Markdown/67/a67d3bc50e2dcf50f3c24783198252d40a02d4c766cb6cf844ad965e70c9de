I"<p>The official website for Evan Chaninkski. But who is he…</p>

<p><strong>Evan Chaninkski</strong> is an illusion. He is actually about 21 rats that form a swarm in the approximate shape of a writer in Canada. Together, the rats are capable of remarkable tasks, such as holding a pen and riding a bicycle really fast. His creativity is sparked by ordering a box of 72 mini donuts, and then drained by having to write about stuff that isn’t mini donuts. When the rats aren’t procrastinating, they are usually washing the dishes.</p>
