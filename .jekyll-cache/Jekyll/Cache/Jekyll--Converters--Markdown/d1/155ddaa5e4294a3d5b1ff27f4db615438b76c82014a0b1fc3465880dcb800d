I"g<p>In 2049 peaches have been outlawed for their allergenic properties. At least 60% of the world is allergic to the fruit. However, a small group of farmers out East still secretly farm the illegal fruit. I met one of the farmers once. It was at a donut stand.</p>

<p>I told him a joke and he leaned in close after laughing, discreetly handing me a peach.</p>

<p>"A gift for making an old farmer laugh" he said.</p>

<p>It must have been decades since I held a peach, let alone tasted.</p>

<p>After thanking the farmer I went home with the peach.</p>

<p>I stared upon the fruit, deep in contemplation of how I should consume the delicacy.</p>

<p>Then I remembered the dish my uncle used to make. He was a farmer too. I searched through old papers until I found the recipe.</p>

<p>â€“</p>

<p>I was all set to begin the baking until I realized it called for blueberries.</p>

<p>Blueberries have been outlawed even longer than peaches, even since the Bluebonic Plague of '32.</p>

<p>I would not take no for an answer. I knew there was still one place to get blueberries. Deep in the seedy underworld of downtown, between alleys, there was the underground blueberry market.</p>

<p>At the market I met a person with a large hat that called themselves, Grape.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for a basket of blueberries" I said.</p>

<p>"Whoa," replied Grape. "We don't use that word. Here we call them eyes."</p>

<p>Grape revealed a baggie full of the fruit.</p>

<p>"$200"</p>

<p>I handed Grape the money and make my way home.</p>

<p>The door to my apartment was open when I arrived. Two officers stood standing in my room. One was holding the peach.</p>

<p>"Is this peach your possession?"</p>

<p>The other officer looked in my bag. "The suspect is carry blueberries."</p>

<p>I was handcuffed and forced into the back of a van with no windows.</p>

<p>I should have never taken the peach.</p>
