<p>Two days and nights have passed since the destined to be Goblin Chef left his home. His loaf of Evan‚Äôs Bread was already half eaten and he was craving something different to consume. The goblin didn‚Äôt expect his wishes to be granted so soon, when he arrived at a small hut. What awaited him was GF Bread.</p>

<p>The goblin was lost when he found the hut deep in the Forests of Vankoo. Inside the goblin found a relatively large dwarf sitting by a fire. 
‚ÄúWelcome little creature. My name is Garret Farwood.‚Äù The dwarf said in a deep voice gesturing to the goblin to take a seat next to the fire. 
The dwarf Garret Farwood noticed the goblin taking out his bread for a meal.
‚ÄúSave your bread little goblin. Here have my bread, GF Bread. It is much healthier.‚Äù</p>

<p>The goblin took the fresh loaf out of the bread machine and wrapped it in cloth. He delicately placed the wrapped bread on the top of his now full rucksack. He was ready for his journey.</p>

<p>With the smell of fresh bread, the goblin left his small home, a hole in the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the destined to be Goblin Chef.</p>
