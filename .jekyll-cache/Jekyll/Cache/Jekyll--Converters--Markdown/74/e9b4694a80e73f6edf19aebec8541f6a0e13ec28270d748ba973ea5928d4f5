<p>The destined to be Goblin Chef gathered all the necessary supplies in his little home. He only had one little sac of a bag so he had to choose wisely what to bring. These items included his paper passport, a family dagger, important rocks, toothbrush, etc.</p>

<p>Once everything was done being packed the goblin looked back at the letter. Its handwriting was sloppy but regardless it said that he was to report to Egathpord. It was his civic goblin duty.</p>

<p>It was going to be a long journey. Potentially dangerous. Egathpord was far and the trail that avoided dragon territory was undocumented. It was going to be an adventure!</p>

<p>It was also going to be a long journey. And a long journey would require food. The goblin was not a chef yet, and only knew one recipe: Evan's Bread.</p>

<p>The goblin learned the recipe during goblin school. It has kept him fed for many years and would continue to do so.</p>

        <p>A homemade gluten free bread for girlfriends. Is it perfect? Definitely not, but that's the price of avoiding gluten. </p>

<h4 id="post">Post</h4>
<p>The goblin took the fresh loaf out of the bread machine and wrapped it in cloth. He delicately placed the wrapped bread on the top of his now full rucksack. He was ready for his journey.</p>

<p>With the smell of fresh bread, the goblin left his small home, a hole in the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the destined to be Goblin Chef.</p>
