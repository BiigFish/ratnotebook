    <h1>Peach Blueberry Crisp</h1>
    <time>August 5, 2021</time>
    <span class="description">Yes the picture sucks. I accidentally ate all of it before I snapped it.</span>
    <hr>
    <h4>Pre</h4> <p> In 2049 peaches have been outlawed for their allergenic properties. At least 60% of the world is allergic to the fruit. However, a small group of farmers out East still secretly farm the illegal fruit. I met one of the farmers once. It was at a donut stand. </p> <p> I told him a joke and he leaned in close after laughing, discreetly handing me a peach. </p> <p> “A gift for making an old farmer laugh” he said. </p> <p> It must have been decades since I held a peach, let alone tasted. </p> <p> After thanking the farmer I went home with the peach. </p> <p> I stared upon the fruit, deep in contemplation of how I should consume the delicacy. </p> <p> Then I remembered the dish my uncle used to make. He was a farmer too. I searched through old papers until I found the recipe. </p>

    <h4>Post</h4> <p> I was all set to begin the baking until I realized it called for blueberries. </p> <p> Blueberries have been outlawed even longer than peaches, even since the Bluebonic Plague of ‘32. </p> <p> I would not take no for an answer. I knew there was still one place to get blueberries. Deep in the seedy underworld of downtown, between alleys, there was the underground blueberry market. </p> <p> At the market I met a person with a large hat that called themselves, Grape. </p> <p> “I’m looking for a basket of blueberries” I said. </p> <p> “Whoa,” replied Grape. “We don’t use that word. Here we call them eyes.” </p> <p> Grape revealed a baggie full of the fruit. </p> <p> “$200” </p> <p> I handed Grape the money and make my way home. </p> <p> The door to my apartment was open when I arrived. Two officers stood standing in my room. One was holding the peach. </p> <p> “Is this peach your possession?” </p> <p> The other officer looked in my bag. “The suspect is carry blueberries.” </p> <p> I was handcuffed and forced into the back of a van with no windows. </p> <p> I should have never taken the peach. </p>
