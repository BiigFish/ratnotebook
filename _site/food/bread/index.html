<p>The most important thing for any journey is food. And for a goblin, that food would be bread.</p>

<p>Our protagonist, the destined to be Goblin Chef read the note one more time. Its handwriting was sloppy but regardless it said that he was to report to Egathpord. It was his civic goblin duty.</p>

<p>And so the goblin gathered all his important possessions into a backpack. These items included his paper passport, a family dagger, important rocks, toothbrush, etc.</p>

<p>It was going to be a long journey. And so the goblin made the one meal he knew, Evanâ€™s Bread.</p>

<p>The goblin took the fresh loaf out of the bread machine and wrapped it in cloth. He delicately placed it on the top of his now full rucksack. He was now ready for his journey.</p>

<p>With the smell of fresh bread, the goblin left his small home, a hole in the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the destined to be Goblin Chef.</p>

                You should specify what bread machine you use otherwise this recipe is useless.
