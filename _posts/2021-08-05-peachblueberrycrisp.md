    In 2049 peaches have been outlawed for their allergenic properties. At
    least 60% of the world is allergic to the fruit. However, a small group of
    farmers out East still secretly farm the illegal fruit. I met one of the
    farmers once. It was at a donut stand.
</p>
<p>
    I told him a joke and he leaned in close after laughing, discreetly handing
    me a peach.
</p>
<p>
    “A gift for making an old farmer laugh” he said.
</p>
<p>
    It must have been decades since I held a peach, let alone tasted.
</p>
<p>
    After thanking the farmer I went home with the peach.
</p>
<p>
    I stared upon the fruit, deep in contemplation of how I should consume the
    delicacy.

    Then I remembered the dish my uncle used to make. He was a farmer too. I
    searched through old papers until I found the recipe.

    “Whoa,” replied Grape. “We don’t use that word. Here we call them eyes.”

I was all set to begin the baking until I realized it called for blueberries.

Blueberries have been outlawed even longer than peaches, even since the Bluebonic Plague of &#39;32.

I would not take no for an answer. I knew there was still one place to get blueberries. Deep in the seedy underworld of downtown, between alleys, there was the underground blueberry market.

At the market I met a person with a large hat that called themselves, Grape.

&quot;I&#39;m looking for a basket of blueberries&quot; I said.

&quot;Whoa,&quot; replied Grape. &quot;We don&#39;t use that word. Here we call them eyes.&quot;

Grape revealed a baggie full of the fruit.

&quot;$200&quot;

I handed Grape the money and make my way home.

The door to my apartment was open when I arrived. Two officers stood standing in my room. One was holding the peach.

&quot;Is this peach your possession?&quot;

The other officer looked in my bag. &quot;The suspect is carry blueberries.&quot;

I should have never taken the peach.
