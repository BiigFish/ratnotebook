**No Code Today**

Now that the new blog page was finished yesterday I need to start a new thing to code. And starting new things is a pain in the ass so instead I didn't do any coding at all today.

Instead I did some writing. I've been trying to write some sort of book review of Utopia Avenue. Its a rock n roll book and I took a rock n roll uni class once and had to write book reviews in that class. So I really want to send a book review of Utopia Avenue to that prof. 

But writing book reviews are sooo boring. Like a recommend it. Done.

So it's been like half a year of constant rewriting a review of this book. Each time I write less and less stuff about the book and more and more about idk... life?

Anyways, I am finally happy with today's version of the review. It'll probably be on the website if you're so inclined to read it. But before that it needs an edit so that will be fun. At least it's short.
