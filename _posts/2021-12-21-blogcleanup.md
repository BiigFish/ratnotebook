**Nothing Exciting**

Just cleaning up the new blog made yesterday. That blog I made a list of things to complete and I've happily finished them all, except for being able to filter tags but that's a much later task.

However all the little things I made are kind of half ass. A little too simple for my taste, kind of missing the modern slickness. But, I'm too lazy to seriously make a good design.

Anyways, that's all the RatNotebook website stuff to change. Time to find a new coding project...

Also rewrote a book review for Utopia Avenue for the forth time. I feel like this might be the time that I've nailed it. Still too rough to know if it's any good or not yet.

Well, that's all there is. The first of many useless posts.
