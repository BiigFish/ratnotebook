## Pre

Meanwhile at the egg factory...

Alarms were ringing and flashing red lights were illuminating the rooms.

"Turn that damn alarm off," yelled Chief Director Zakarr.

A total egg-tastrophe. No one sure how it started. But the results are clear. 

Almost all the shelves in Storage room #21 have fallen onto each other like dominoes. And all the eggs on said shelves have fallen towards the ground and shattered.

"How many eggs are we talking about?" asked reporter Phelps on the phone with an insider at the factory.

"Somewhere around six to nine thousand eggs." replied the phone.

Phelps wrote the number in his notebook to be published in the afternoon column. Disaster at the Egg Factory.

Meanwhile in a Meeting Room C-2, Director Zakarr is speaking with the heads of all the departments of the factory. Except for Gary, the manager of Storage Room #21. He's sitting in a small dark room locked in the basement, to be questioned later.

But first a solution must be met before blame is dealt.

"So currently we have thousands of eggs lying on the floor? Is this correct?" asked Director Zakarr in a threatening voice.

Everyone in the room nodded very slightly while avoiding eye contact. 

Supervisor Chain spoke up, "Approximately 30% of the eggs are completely destroyed. The ground is stained with yokes. I've already began the cleaning operation on them. However, the other 70% are cracked but still relatively intact. While we won't be able to sell them, we can still salvage them if we use them immediately."

"So what are we supposed to do with 8361 partially cracked eggs?"

The room was silent.

Then, Christina spoke up. She wasn't even supposed to be here. She was supposed to be in class learning french right now. But today was take-your-kid-to-work-day. "I heard that the banana factory had lots of extra bananas this season. You could team up and make banana bread."

## Post

Reporter Phelps almost spat his coffee when we heard the news on the phone. "They're what? The Egg Factory is teaming up with the Banana Factory to make Banana Bread?"

The news was true. The two factories were incredibly busy. The egg factory had workers delicately picking up the partially cracked eggs off the already egg soaked floor. These eggs were placed in baskets and then cracked into giant vats. These vats were transferred to a nearby bakery. 

Meanwhile the Banana Factory were all too happy to send their excess of bananas to the bakery as well. For they had a miscalculation at the beginning of the season and accidentally produced 30% more bananas than they should have. They tried to sell the excess this season with a buy 1 get 1 deal, but it didn't catch on. They were about to throw the excess (now rotting) bananas into the trash until they got the message from the Egg Factory.

A collaboration between the Egg and Banana Factory. No one would have ever thought the day would come. Especially after the divorce between the two directors. But sometimes two disasters at once can make wounds heal. A perfect storm.

Meanwhile...

"This is the worst. This is hell!" yelled Chef Barbon. "The one time I take a vacation all year and these damn factories tell me I have to bake 3000 banana breads."

Chef Barbon's bakery wasn't even large. It was small that fitted six bakers in total. They furiously baked loaf after loaf, while outside trucks awaited to deliver eggs and bananas. 

Chef Barbon continued his rant while he baked, "And each factory is taking 30% cut. Each! We're not even making much profit out of this. And we have to pay for the flour, butter, sugar, salt, cinnamon,..."

Chef Barbon's wife spoke up, "You'd think the Banana Factory could have just made banana pudding, and the Egg Factory make quiche."
