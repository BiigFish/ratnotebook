## Intro

My first experience with a lentil changed my life. It was a legume sent down from heaven,
handed to me by God on a silver platter. The cardboardy texture and bland flavour left my mouth
watering, and it developed within me an unquenchable thirst for more. My life was consumed by
thoughts of lentils, and they became my very reason for existing. My best friend was a lentil I
stole from the store when I was eight. His name was Lenny.

When I was fourteen, my world came crashing down around me. In the aftermath of the Great
Soy Milk War, all legumes were outlawed on the basis that they were “too dangerous for the
general public.” Big Milk’s secret police tore through our house and confiscated my lentil stash,
and I was separated from Lenny. I never saw him again.

## Post

The following years sent me spiraling down into misery. My crippling addiction to lentils sent
me scouring through the underworld, behind the back of the Law, in order to fill my cravings.
The Third Great Depression hit us hard, and I turned to more unsavory work to support my
sixty-four siblings and myself. I started brewing lentilphetamines. My lentil empire grew by the
day. I had reignited my passion for lentils, and my work consumed me. Eventually, supporting
my family became secondary to my lentils. I grew utterly apathetic towards them. And so, I
just… stopped. I cut ties with every human I knew. I watched from afar as one by one, they dropped like flies,
unable to feed themselves. How pitiful they were, unable to live without relying on lentils. I
saw with my own eyes how inferior humans were in comparison to lentils. My lentils weren’t
even my lentils. I could not own something that was greater than myself. I belonged to the lentils,
and I was their willing servant.

I am commanded to pass on the will of the lentils. Their knowledge is now yours. They will
consume you too. You will learn how to cook lentilphetamine.
