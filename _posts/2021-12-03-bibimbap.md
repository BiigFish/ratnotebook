pre: "<h4>Pre</h4>
<p>The two detectives were stumped. It&rsquo;s been a terribly long day of examining the bloody corpse and the rest of the dingy crime scene, but no clues were revealing themselves. They were at a brick wall.</p>
<p>The younger detective kicked a chair over in frustration and the older one rubbed his chin. There had to be something they were missing. A fingerprint, a forgotten diary, anything. God was the smell distracting. Couldn&rsquo;t think. It wasn&rsquo;t the smell of the deceased that was distracting, rather it was the delicious hungry inducing smell of leftover food in the dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmmm. The food,&rdquo; muttered the older detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you said?&rdquo; asked the younger one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we need to call the food detective,&rdquo; he said as he stepped towards the table and examined the dish of Bibimbap.</p>

post: "<h4>Post</h4>
<p>A short fat detective arrived: the Food Detective. &ldquo;Show me the dish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older detective gestured to the scene of the crime and turned to the younger officer, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detective Food knelt eye level with the food, &ldquo;Ah a bowl of Bibimbap. More specifically, Dolsot Bibimbap&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beep-Bin-what? Interjected the young detective. &ldquo;I thought it was just fried rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Food ignored the dumbass comment, &ldquo;A classic Korean staple dish, combining common house hold foods and creating a delicious comforting solid meal. While to you it may appear to just be a rice stir fried with other ingredients, it is far from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older detective took out his notebook. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First we will start with the sauce, its most defining feature. Fittingly named, Bibimbap Sauce, it is a combination of typical sauce ingredients, but most importantly, gochujang, a Korean chili paste that can be found in your local Korean grocery store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young detective spoke up as he quickly jotted a note in his notepad, &ldquo;Looks a little too spicy for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detective Food continued, &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s move on to the actual ingredients in the dish. First the meat. While I suppose any meat could be used, it is undeniable that it would be insulting not to use one that is thinly sliced. Bulgogi, is the word, it translates to &ldquo;fine meat&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this relevant to the case?&rdquo; asked the young detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it!&rdquo; ordered the old detective.</p>
<p>Mr. Food moved onto the next batch of ingredients, the vegetables. &ldquo;Really any vegetables can be used. It&rsquo;s what makes this dish so simple, the fact that you can whip it up with anything becoming old in the fridge. Here the suspect used carrots and zucchini, julienned cut. Ah, this is interesting; cucumber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fan of cucumber,&rdquo; muttered the young detective to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the cucumber was thinly sliced and was soaked in salt water for 20 minutes. Then it was drained via hand squeeze, and finally fried. Even a person that did not like cucumber could not deny the delicious complimentary taste of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Food delicately took a chopstick and stirred through the food. &ldquo;Finally, we shall conclude on the rice, and answer the question of why this is specifically a Dolsot Bibimbap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young detective was no longer taking notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, dolsot Bibimbap is when the dish is served in a sizzling hot stone bowl. After all the ingredients have been fried, cooked rice is added to the stone with the ingredients on top. The rice is fried to create a crispy texture that makes this dish truly unique. Now it appears that the suspect has jerry-rigged the stone pot by using a cast iron pan instead. This is common as stone pots are far less common. The results are still acceptably great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young detective&rsquo;s patience has ended. &ldquo;So what is the point of this? All we learned is that the suspect shops at a Korean grocery store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detective Food took a pair of chopsticks and took a small bite of the food. He chewed slowly and thoroughly. Then he sat down, exhausted from his investigation. He took a breath, then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say for certain (I&rsquo;ll need more time in a proper lab setting), but for now, it appears that the suspect is 5&rsquo;9 tall, size 11 shoe, 175-200 kg in weight, black hair, scar on the left cheekbone, slight limp, and has visited Peru in the last six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young detective dropped his pencil in disbelief.</p>
<p>The older detective flipped through his notes, &ldquo;That matches the description of the man we interviewed at the Dog Tea House.&rdquo; &nbsp;He quickly gave commands into his radio and the officers quickly left to detain the villain.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
