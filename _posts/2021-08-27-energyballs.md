pre: "<h4>Pre</h4>
<p>For a while the only light was the glow of the city on our backs. But then the sunrise started to appear in our direction. So, we were walking east. I turned for one last look back home. Well, not home anymore.</p>
<p>I looked forward again and at Kat. She was walking about twenty paces ahead. Her backpack looked heavy and the sleeves of her shirt were stained with blood. I looked at my own sleeves: covered in blood. So was the rest of my shirt, and my pants, and dried blood covered my hands.</p>
<p>While distracted I tripped on a rock or something and slowly fell to the ground. It was fine, nothing hurt, but it was enough to cause Kat to turn around and ask what the fuck I was doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired&rdquo; I replied weakly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Kat looked at the disappearing stars in annoyance. &ldquo;Listen we can&rsquo;t stop. We need to keep walking away from all this.&rdquo; She looked back at me. I was still sitting in my post falling position.</p>
<p>Kat shook her head and looked in her bag. She took a baggie of energy balls and held out one to me. &ldquo;Cmon she said, it&rsquo;s going to be light out soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got up and took the energy ball. I took a bite and we started walking again, side by side.</p>
<p>I was surprised by the taste of the snack. It was good. I took my thoughts away of the bloody corpse that was now rotting in the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made these?&rdquo; I asked, trying further to forget the feeling of a knife stabbing into flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah I did.&rdquo; She replied. &ldquo;Want me to tell you how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>"

post: "<h4>Post</h4>
<p>Night had fully vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what now?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We keep walking,&rdquo; Kat replied, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll stop when we feel safe. But murder is a pretty big deal, and we&rsquo;ll never feel safe. That&rsquo;s no problem. We&rsquo;re strong, we can keep walking. We can push forward. There&rsquo;s always something new, just around the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a lot of work&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Kat looked towards the clouds, &ldquo;Yeah it will be. But we&rsquo;re tough, especially when we got these.&rdquo; Kat shook the baggie full of energy balls. She tossed me one. I caught it, and took a bite.</p>
<p>So we kept walking. Walking down roads and fields, through bushes and rivers, into towns and restaurants, past people and families, always going further. Never stopping.</p>
<p>Never stopping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"
