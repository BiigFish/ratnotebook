## Intro

Hi y’all! Welcome to Mama Mary’s Oreo Cheesecake Recipe! :) I’m so glad you could be here
with us.

I remember the first time I made an oreo cheesecake. It was 1985 and I was in the orchard
with my papa. I’ll always remember how we picked those oreos fresh from the tree! If you
can’t get your own fresh oreos, don’t worry — God will forgive you. This recipe calls for a lot
of cream cheese, so make sure Old Bessy has enough milk to make it yourself! If you don’t
have your own cow, this isn’t the recipe for you.

My 3 kids love this recipe — I’d make it for them every year when the oreos were in season.
One of my kids suggested one year that we make Smartie cheesecake instead. I told him,
“Smarties don’t grow on trees, silly!” We don’t talk to him anymore because he’s a heathen.

Mama Mary’s cheesecake recipe is made from all natural ingredients :)
