## Mama Mary's Recipe

Hi y’all! Welcome to Mama Mary’s Oreo Cheesecake Recipe! :) I’m so glad you could be here
with us.

I remember the first time I made an oreo cheesecake. It was 1985 and I was in the orchard
with my papa. I’ll always remember how we picked those oreos fresh from the tree! If you
can’t get your own fresh oreos, don’t worry — God will forgive you. This recipe calls for a lot
of cream cheese, so make sure Old Bessy has enough milk to make it yourself! If you don’t
have your own cow, this isn’t the recipe for you.

My 3 kids love this recipe — I’d make it for them every year when the oreos were in season.
One of my kids suggested one year that we make Smartie cheesecake instead. I told him,
“Smarties don’t grow on trees, silly!” We don’t talk to him anymore because he’s a heathen.

Mama Mary’s cheesecake recipe is made from all natural ingredients :)

Remember, this recipe belongs to Mama Mary and not to any of these other websites
pretending it’s theirs!! I’m talking to you, Carol-Ann, you husband-stealing whore. I SEE you
put my oreo cheesecake recipe on your website! Take it down or I WILL be calling my lawyer!

Lots of love,

Mama Mary <3

## Carol-Anne's Recipe

Hi y’all! Just a little update to this recipe blog. You may have noticed that this same recipe,
my Oreo Cheesecake Recipe that was passed down from my mother’s sister’s cousin’s aunt’s
close-friend(-who-we-all-know-is-her-wife)’s acquaintance’s dog’s nephew twice removed,
was spotted on Mama Mary’s blog. She was postin’ slanderous nonsense sayin’ that I stole
this recipe from her. No wonder her son doesn’t talk to her anymore. I wanted to remind y’all
that this recipe was passed down to me! It is my recipe and I will be speakin’ to my lawyers
about having Mama Mary’s Recipe website taken down.

It should also be known that I didn’t steal your husband, Mary, he sprinted away from you
and all your lies.

Take down the oreo cheesecake recipe you stole from me off of your blog and delete those
slanderous comments. Remember, God is always watchin’, and so are the lawyers paid for by
your ex-husband.

Love Always, Carol-Ann
