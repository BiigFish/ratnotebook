comment-demon: This is sooo dumb
comment-daisy: I love it! This is the best website 4ever!
comment-goose: where am I?
comment-willis: This is ridiculous. From the pretentious rat blurb to the obvious fake name, this website appears to be run by a 13 year old.

The official website for **Evan Chaninkski**. But who is he...

**Evan Chaninkski** is an illusion. He is actually about 21 rats that form a swarm in the approximate shape of a writer in Canada. Together, the rats are capable of remarkable tasks, such as holding a pen and riding a bicycle really fast. His creativity is sparked by ordering a box of 72 mini donuts, and then drained by having to write about stuff that isn’t mini donuts. When the rats aren’t procrastinating, they are usually washing the dishes. 

To stay up to date with **Evan Chaninkski's** work, you should visit this website every morning or evening.
