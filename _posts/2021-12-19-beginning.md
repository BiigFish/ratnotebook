**Resolutions**

* Quit the video games

Oh so much time has been wasted. My life has been video games. I've even got second nature habit of keeping up to date with it. But 2022 has never been a better year to quit. First of all, games now suck hard. They're designed too well at being additive over actually being fun. 

So it's time to quit. But quitting any addiction is hard and will require steps.

1. This laptop

I can't believe what a great decision it was to buy a laptop. Before I was using an old desktop, but now I've got a speedy laptop that very importantly: has no graphics card! I can't play games. Also it's given me the opportunity to start fresh and redownload all the old programs, but more importantly, not to download a bunch. I feel like I have a clean new slate.

2. New Addictions

Gotta do something instead of video games. I bought a bunch of books to read to replace gaming. But really I hope I take the opportunity of all this new found time to be more productive.

3. This blog

The plan is to write about being productive, to actually make myself productive. I'm sure this will backfire, with me being on day 8 with absolutely nothing to write. But we'll see. I am currently optimistic. It's also 4am in the morning so I'm also probably a little delusional right now.
