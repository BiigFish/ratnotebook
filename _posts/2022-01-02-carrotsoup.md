#### Pre

Mine #32 - Level 6 - Conference Room #8.

All the high execs of the Mine #32 gather to discuss the current affairs. 

Chief Engineer concludes the positive news of the flooding on level 62 has resolved itself. The casualties being $1575 of destroyed tools and 19 miners.

"What's the status of the newest levels, 89? asks Warden Krave.

A silence and then Foreman Zeke speaks up, "The power from generators K1-K5 do not reach any levels beyond 88. While no actual components require any power beyond here, the miners have no lights. With the budget cuts of no portable lights, the miners have no way to see in these levels. Productivity has decreased by 61% and accidents by 88%."

"These are unacceptable numbers," says Warden Krave.

Chief Engineer, "we could build new generators at the lower levels."

Economist, "The cost of that would be too high."

Electrician, "Can't you extend cables from generators K1-K5?"

Chief Engineer, "The flooded levels of 62 prevent this."

A silence. Warden Krave stares at each member around the table. Until he reaches Chef Ivan.

"Perhaps, I have a solution," says Chef Ivan.

Everyone turns to look at the chef.

"Although unconventional, I may be able to assist the miners in a rather cost effective manner. I know a recipe that will allow the miners to see in the dark."

"What is this recipe?" asks Warden Krave.

"Carrot Soup."

Mine #32 - Level 91 - Elevator

The slow manual pulley elevator descends. 

The elevator stops.

Someone pulls the door open.

Light from the elevator shines into the pitch black tunnel. But not pitch black for Joseph or the other dozen miners by his side. They exit the elevator and journey down the tunnel.

It's narrow and crude, rocks jutt out and the tall ones are forced to kneel slightly.

Joseph reaches the end where others are already hammering their pickaxes against the hard rock. Joseph begins.

"What do you plan to do once you're out?" asks Fellow Miner Vishal.

Joseph continues to swing the pickaxe while he replies, "I want to become a chef."

"You cook?"

"Haha no. But it's my dream. To work with vegetables instead of rocks. To serve warm food instead of cold minerals."

"You should try to get noticed on Level 11. I head they're always short staffed in the kitchen."

"I don't want to cook here. Who would want to cook disgusting food."

"Well then even more reason to cook here. Make the food good. Do not move away hoping it'd be better somewhere else. You would be a coward. Make the change here! Stay and make your own change."

Joseph stopped mining and turned to look at Fellow Miner Vishal. "Where did that come from?"

"I'm just tired of eating shit," replies Fellow Miner Vishal.

"The new carrot soup isn't bad."

"Yeah the taste of coconut makes it."

Jospeh strikes the rock. A crack forms and begins to grow. Water starts to spirit out of the cracks. The cracks become larger. More water.

The miners yell and rush for the elevator. 

The elevator is not there, instead it's on level 76. 

One day later.

Mine #32 - Level 6 - Conference Room #8.

Chief Engineer, "Well it appears that the flooding on Level 91 is from the same reservoir as Level 62.

"So now it's dark and flooded." Warden Krave says angerly. "What the hell do we do now?"

The room is silent.

"I may have a solution," says Chef Ivan.

Everyone turns to look at the chef.

"Although unconventional, I may be able to assist the miners in a rather cost effective manner. I know a recipe that will allow the miners to breathe in the water."
