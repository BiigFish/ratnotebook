**Reviews**

Well the Utopia Avenue book review editing is done. And I am happy with it. For like half a year I've been struggling on writing that review.

The concept of a review is tough for me. Like to write a whole thing about why I like or dislike something. It's all opinions man. I like it cause I like it. Its good cause its good. End of story. I don't want to spoil why it's good.

So the first few attempts of writing the review was just sooooo boring. It was too technical and bla bla bla. It was too bullshit.

I spend my life watching reviews. I'm really into reviews. And yet I could not write one.

But I feel like I nailed this one. And what was the trick? Hell if I know? Write a lot of jokes in it? Well, yeah jokes help.

Maybe the trick was using the review as a medium to write. An excuse to write about the feelings and thoughts associated with the thing being reviewed.

Well, maybe I'll do a review one day in the future. And we'll see if its any easier than last time.
